# Startup-Funding-Analysis-Using-Power-BI-Dashboard
<strong><h3>Introduction: </h3></strong>
<p>This project aims to study the funding patterns using the available 
data from the recent years. Analyzing funding patterns is important 
because they serve as an indicator of innovation in a country and 
reveal which kind of ideas are being supported and funded by the 
investors. Additionally, this analysis helps us understand which sector 
receives the most funding and which state has the highest number of 
funded startups. </p>
